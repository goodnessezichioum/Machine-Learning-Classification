# Decision Tree Tutorial: Effect of Pruning on Overfitting and Accuracy

This repository contains the materials and code for a tutorial on decision trees, focusing on how pruning affects overfitting and accuracy. The tutorial uses the Heart Disease dataset to demonstrate these concepts.

## Contents

- **`tutorial_script.pdf`**: The transcript of the video tutorial.
- **`machine-learning-classification.py`**: A Notebook with code to replicate the analysis and figures.
- **`data/`**: The Heart Disease dataset used in the tutorial.
- **`plots/`**: Figures generated from the code.


## Tutorial Highlights

In this tutorial, you will:
1. Load and preprocess the Heart Disease dataset.
2. Build an unpruned decision tree and evaluate its accuracy.
3. Understand and apply pruning techniques, including:
   - Limiting maximum depth.
   - Cost-complexity pruning (`ccp_alpha`).
4. Visualize decision trees before and after pruning.
5. Evaluate the performance of pruned and unpruned models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the code, ensure you have Python 3.x installed with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
